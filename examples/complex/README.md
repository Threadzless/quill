# Complex example

This example features a lot of standard widget types such as buttons, sliders, dialog boxes,
splitter bars, and so on. However, these are strictly "demo" widgets, and not intended for
production use (which is why they live in the examples directory and are not part of the
library.)

It is anticipated that a standardizes library of widgets may come along later, but that will
be a different crate, and will (hopefully) compete with other crates that define their own
widget styles.
